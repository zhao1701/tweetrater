As a form of electronic communication, tweets contain user handles, hashtags, URL's, and emoticons, which will need to be addressed in addition to standard NLP processing techniques such as lemmatization. Furthermore, as a casual messaging and posting medium, special care also needs to be paid to misspellings, spacing errors, abbreviations, slang, and other anomalies arising from looser notions of grammar and syntax (all of which are more extreme in the case of offensive and racist tweets)."

If two such words are judged to be essentially the same, then their embedding vectors will reflect the similarity, and overfitting can be avoided."
