    "Whereas Naive Bayes models learn and predict on some form of term frequency vectors, [neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) can use [word vector embeddings](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/word2vec) in which each word is represented as a vector of pre-defined dimensionality. The key to the vector space model is that words with similar semantic meanings are also represented as similar vectors (as measured by some distance metric such as cosine similarity). There exist many methods to embedding the semantic meaning of a word, but they share in common the notion that a word's meaning can be defined by the totality of the contexts in which the word appears. In other words, a word's meaning is defined by its neighbors."

    "Previously, when using term frequency models, a tweet was represented as a single vector. However, if instead, words are represented as vectors, and a tweet is a collection of words, then a tweet is represented not as a vector but as a matrix where the $i^{th}$ row is the vector embedding of the $i^{th}$ word in the tweet. This matrix representation of a tweet provides a similarity to the classification of images that is especially useful when working with convolutional neural networks later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The conversion of a tweet into a matrix involves two elements: an index sequence vector and an embedding matrix. In this model, given a vocabulary of size $v$, each term of the vocabulary is assigned a unique index value from $0$ to $v-1$. A tweet's index sequence vector, then, is a vector in which its $i^{th}$ element is the index value of the $i^{th}$ word in the tweet.\n",
    "\n",
    "An embedding matrix of size $v \\times d$, where $d$ is a pre-specified dimensionality of the word vector embeddings, is a matrix in which the $n^{th}$ row is the $d$-dimensional vector embedding of the term corresponding to index value $n$. Thus, with an index sequence vector, we can select which rows of the embedding matrix to use to build a tweet's representational matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given our corpus of 13,000 tweets and vocabulary of 16,500, a 100-dimensional vector embedding is sufficient (prior tests showed that 100-dimensional embeddings outperformed 50 and 200-dimensional embeddings). We remove from the vocabulary all words that appear only once in the corpus since one set of neighbors does not seem to be enough to discern a word's meaning. Excluding all terms that appear in the corpus once leaves over 6,000 terms, much higher than the 186 terms used by Bernoulli Naive Bayes for classification.\n",

    "A potential reason for the absence of hate speech identification is that the MLP is actually handicapped by the choice of tweet representation model. Recall that when tweets were represented as term frequency vectors for Naive Bayes classification, the models trained and predicted a tweet rating only on the basis of the presence or multiplicity of terms in the tweet. In other words, it did not matter where the term occurs in the tweet, only that it did occur some number of times. When using a matrix of vector embeddings to represent the tweet instead, the position in which terms occur within a tweet become part of the model, so for example, \"apples and oranges\" and \"oranges and apples\" are converted into different vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lack of translational invariance could mean that under this representational model, the MLP would require more samples of hate speech than what is currently available to learn how to identify it. Using image classification to illustrate this issue, imagine an MLP designed to distinguish circles from other shapes. If we only gave it as positive samples images with circles in the upper left hand corner, the model would not be able to identify a circle located in any of the other corners. Similarly, if we provided the model as positive samples only four images of a circle each placed in a different corner, the model would likely not be able to identify a circle at all.\n",

    "1. ------ fuck you\n",
    "2. ------ you fuck\n",
    "3. fuck you ------\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a term frequency model, the three tweets would be identical, so the classifier has essentially three training samples with which to learn that any permutation of \"------\", \"fuck\", and \"you\" should be considered hate speech. However, with a matrix embedding model, the same three tweets would convert to different matrices, like circles in different corners of an image, and the classifier may not learn that any of them much less a new permutation should be considered hate speech."

    "# Convolutional Neural Network\n",
    "[Convolutional neural networks](http://www.wildml.com/2015/12/implementing-a-cnn-for-text-classification-in-tensorflow/) were originally developed to address the issues of translational and scaling variance in image classification problems. In a traditional CNN, two-dimensional convolutional filters (the kernels of which are learned through training) scan the image to detect the presence of salient features, and the results of such scans are pooled and fed forward through the network. Because the second dimension of a tweet embedding matrix holds no particular meaning, we use one-dimensional convolutional filters instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "The topology of the optimal CNN for tweet classification is extremely small, consisting of only one convolutional layer, a *global* max pooling layer (which is typical for NLP), and no additional hidden layers, and even this network tends to significantly overfit. Some light dropout regularization is applied to the network, though previous tests revealed that fully controlling overfitting tended to hurt validation accuracy."
